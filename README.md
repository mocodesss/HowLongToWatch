# HowLongToWatch
Little C program that calculates how long it will take to watch a video on a certain speed. Accepts user inputs ad calculates an output, all in the terminal.


Future additions/changes: 
- add conversions between decimals and minutes/seconds so the user doesn't have to do it themselves
- make JS version and then build UI w/ CSS & HTML
